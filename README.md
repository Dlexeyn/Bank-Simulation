# Bank-Simulation
An implementation of the Banker algorithm that verifies the safety of the state
by simulating the allocation of pre-determined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then performing a status check to consider possible deadlock conditions for all other pending actions before deciding whether to allow continued allocation.
